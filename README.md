# Automated mRNA Vaccine Creation via AI based mRNA Transcoding

Published 11/01/2025

Concept authored by Joshuah P. Baker, CC BY-NC, Copyleft 2025, all dirivatives must remain in the public domain, open source, 
free for all without limit, or exception.

This project presents an open, conceptual framework for AI-assisted mRNA vaccine design.
The model illustrates how artificial intelligence can automate the translation of viral genomic data into optimized mRNA vaccine candidates through a streamlined, data-driven process.

The framework connects four main components:

Viral RNA Sampling & Data Ingestion – automated intake and formatting of viral sequence information.

Target Identification & Optimization – AI analysis to locate immunogenic regions and generate efficient, stable mRNA sequences.

Transcoding Engine – codon optimization, structure prediction, and in-silico validation guided by machine learning.

Open Vaccine Output – generation of candidate vaccine blueprints for further research or manufacturing under open access principles.

Released publicly to encourage transparent, humanitarian innovation, the project aims to reduce the time between pathogen discovery and vaccine concept generation, particularly in global-health and emergency-response contexts.
It is a conceptual automation model, not a laboratory or clinical protocol.

Intent: to foster collaboration and ensure that AI-enabled biomedical design remains part of the public scientific commons.
